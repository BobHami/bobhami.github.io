**The Boron Letters** is a book...

<!--more-->

Notes:
* Many people consider Gary C. Halbert the greatest copywriter of all time
* Letters written to his son from Prison
* Book was recomended by Nevil and Sam Parr
* They speak of the importance of copywriting -- don't consider myself a good copywriter and not something that I put a lot of thought into apart from the odd email blast
* 25 chapters of rambling stream of consciousness -- but hidden inside are some juicy nuggets


Layout:
* Who is this guy and why do I care?
